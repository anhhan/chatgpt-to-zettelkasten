# Jobs To Be Done Framework

A framework for understanding customer motivation based on the "job" they're trying to accomplish, rather than demographic attributes or product features.

## Core Principle

> Customers don't buy products; they "hire" products to do a job.

The job remains stable even as solutions change. People have been "hiring" solutions to communicate across distance for centuries (letters → telegrams → phones → email → messaging apps).

## The Job Statement Formula

| Component | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **When** | In what situation? | When I'm running late for a meeting... |
| **I want to** | What's the action? | ...I want to notify attendees... |
| **So that** | What's the outcome? | ...so that they can adjust their schedules. |

## Types of Jobs

1. **Functional Jobs** - Practical tasks (get from A to B)
2. **Emotional Jobs** - How they want to feel (feel confident)
3. **Social Jobs** - How they want to be perceived (look professional)

## How to Discover Jobs

### Customer Interviews

Ask about:
- Recent purchase decisions and what triggered them
- Workarounds and compensating behaviors
- Moments of frustration with current solutions

### Observation

Watch for:
- What they do before/after using your product
- Steps they skip or modify
- Tools they combine together

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Focusing on demographics | Jobs cut across segments |
| Asking what features they want | Customers can't design solutions |
| Studying only your product | Miss the full job context |

## Key Insight

> **When you understand the job, you can compete against non-consumption and unexpected competitors. The milkshake's real competition isn't other milkshakes—it's bananas, bagels, and boredom.**
